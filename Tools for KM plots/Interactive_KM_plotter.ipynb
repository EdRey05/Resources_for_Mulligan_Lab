    "***Summary:***\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook allows the user to easily and interactively create Kaplan-Meier probability curves (survival, progression, recurrence) by using the KaplanMeierFitter library for Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Note on the current version (V01):***\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is a first working version that was built based on the METABRIC dataset available on the cBioPortal website (https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=brca_metabric).\n",
    "* This version of the notebook allows to easily generate a KM plot using the whole dataset or subdividing the dataset into multiple groups based on any column/variable contained in the clinical file or in the RNA Sequencing file from the same study.\n",
    "* This version has not yet been tested for other datasets from cBioPortals or elsewhere and no tests have been done with files other than RNA Seq files.\n",
    "* Future releases will be made addressing this: better outputs given by the notebook (KM plot, raw probability estimates, etc.), incorporating the functionality of the button \"Using multiple variables\" to allow the user to make groups based on 2 or more columns/variables, making a version for Google Colab to run online.\n",
    "\n",
    "***How to use this notebook:***\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Getting the files:** Go to the link for cBioportals, get the whole METABRIC study (click on the arrow pointing down, on the right side of the study name). This will download a *.tar.gz* compressed file, where you can find and extract the files ***data_clinical_patient.txt*** and any of the ***data_mrna_illumina...*** files. You can extract them anywhere (desktop or downloads), but preferably in the same folder as where the notebook is (if not, don't worry, the notebook will ask you to upload file(s)).\n",
    "2. ***Rename*** the clinical file to ***clinical.txt*** and the mRNA one to ***RNA.txt***.\n",
    "3. ***Open the notebook*** with JupyterLab, select \"Run\" in the top-left menu, then \"Run all cells\" and wait (~1min).\n",
    "4. ***Look under*** the code block on \"Start plotting here!\".\n",
    "5. ***Plot!***: start by selecting a time variable (the METABRIC study has only Overall Survival), the column with the event to observe, fill the 0 and 1 widgets with the event (0 = No event/Living, 1 = Event/Died). After that you can plot the whole dataset by clicking the green button at the bottom, or select \"Use 1 variable\" to explore different variables and make subgroups. Once subgroups are made by filling the widgets with tags or ranges (please avoid overlapping borders, for example: 0.00-30.**00**, 30.**01**-60.00), you can click the green button to observe the multiple survival probabilities.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**NOTES:** Currently, the button \"Using multiple variables\" does not do anything. You can plot and replot all possible genes or clinical columns in the dataset if you want, just one by one in this version. Also, if you do not need the RNA Seq data, the notebook works with the clinical file alone too. At the moment, the notebook only shows you the plots but future releases will give it as a image file together with an excel file containing the calculated probabilities, in case you want to plot it in your software of preference and do stats there."
